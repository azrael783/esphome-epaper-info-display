# esphome-epaper-info-display

Sharing my esphome code of my e-paper info display showing infos from Home-Assistant. I am using a 2.9in e-paper display from waveshare 
and a ESP32 flashed with esphome to display mainly weather information fetched from Home-Assistant.
Download the files, put the `esp32-display.yaml` and the folder `fonts` into your `/config` folder from esphome, adapt the board info and the pin numbering to your board, flash the ESP after compiling the firmware, connect the display and be happy.
